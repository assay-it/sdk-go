/*

Package sdk is used to develop **pure functional** and **typesafe** Behavior as
a Code to validate applications. https://assay.it automates the validation
process along CI/CD pipelines. Continuous proofs of the quality helps to
eliminate defects at earlier phases of loosely coupled topologies such as
serverless applications, microservices and other systems that rely on interface
syntaxes and its behaviors.

Minimal example is an annotated walk-through and a minimal Behavior as a Code
suite. Use it as getting started tutorial.
