/*

Package sdk is used to develop **pure functional** and **typesafe** Behavior as
a Code to construct automated quality assessment pipelines for your
applications across deployments and environments. Use this SDK to develop CI/CD
suites for https://assay.it. Continuous proofs of the quality helps developers to
eliminate defects at earlier phases of loosely coupled topologies such as
serverless applications, microservices and other systems that rely on interface
syntaxes and its behaviors.
